# madelines-password-creator

## Description
This webpage is my week 3 bootcamp challenge. I was given starter code, which contained the html and css files, plus a few lines of code in the javascript file; I added the code to allow the user to interact with the system, and to actually generate the random password based on the user's input. My knowledge of JavaScript expanded immensly given the opportunity to experiment variables, arrays, prompts, functions, if statements, for loops, etc.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Upon opening the webpage, click on the "generate password" button to initiate the password creation. User will be prompted to answer some questions about the characteristics of the password, including length and character type, Link to deployed application: https://madelinelowes.github.io/madelines-password-creator/
